The purpose of this assignment was to use R and Python to create linear regression models using a dataset modeling based on Salary based on Years of Experience. 
The tools for R that I used were ggplot2. 
The tools I used in Python were pandas, matplotlib, and the scikit learn linear regression model. 
My R-squared value for my graph made with Python was 0.785. The R-squared value for my graphs made with R was 0.7852. 

In part 2 I exported each notebook as a script and modified them to accept arguments. I then ran the scripts from the terminal to get png files of the graphs. To run the scripts, I put the command in the command line and pressed enter. 

The purpose of assignment 3 was to play with version control in GitHub. I cloned my Assignment 2 repo, created a branch, made changes to my original Assignment 2 work, and merged the branch back to the original assignment. 

**Note: I had some trouble with this assignment originally. I had merged all of my changes to GitHub but the only file that was showing in my GitHub repo was my read me file, so I ended up having to make a new repo, upload my assignment 2 files to the new repo, and then add my assignment 3 files to a new branch, and then merge the branch back to the main branch. I believe I have all of the required files now, but I definitely forgot to upload some of the files when I initially made the new repo so I had to add them to the new branch and merge them onto the main. I hope that makes sense! Even JT couldn't help me get the files to show up on the intial repo!!
