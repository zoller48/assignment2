# Purpose for Assignment 2
The purpose of this assignment was to use R and Python to create linear regression models using a dataset modeling based on Salary based on Years of Experience. 
# Tolls used for Assignment 2
The tools for R that I used were ggplot2. 
The tools I used in Python were pandas, matplotlib, and the scikit learn linear regression model. 
My R-squared value for my graph made with Python was 0.785. The R-squared value for my graphs made with R was 0.7852. 

In part 2 I exported each notebook as a script and modified them to accept arguments. I then ran the scripts from the terminal to get png files of the graphs. To run the scripts, I put the command in the command line and pressed enter. 

# Purpose for Assignment 3
The purpose of assignment 3 was to play with version control in GitHub. I cloned my Assignment 2 repo, created a branch, made changes to my original Assignment 2 work, and merged the branch back to the original assignment. 

# Note for Dr. Frietas
I started by trying to upload my Assignment 3 into a new branch on the Assignment 2 repo. When trying to merge the branches, I encountered a bunch of issues regarding commits that were behind or ahead of the main branch. All of the solutions I tried (and JT tried!!!) did not work, so I decided to create a new GitHub Repo and try again. I forgot to upload some of the files to the main repo, so I uploaded them to the branch and merged the branches. I also updated and uploaded this file, but I guess it did not save!
